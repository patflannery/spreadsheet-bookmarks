# spreadsheet-bookmarks
A simple template for making a page that draws data from a Google Spreadsheet, using [Sheetsee.js](https://github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js/).


### How to Use

Create a Google Spreadsheet that mirrors [this example.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1367WmQUo0cjq-MWpOlN-d5Nmtq7CoRUfHOrS9wu5jhA/edit#gid=0) Then select "File > Publish to the Web" and make the sheet public.

In this project's index.html file, be sure to add the spreadsheet URL where it is needed.

Voila! You have a simple public bookmark page that updates when you make changes to the spreadsheet.
